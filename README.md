# FlaTinder
Project 3 for Engineering of Mobile Systems

Context:
Almost everyone has struggled, at least once in their life, finding flatmates, maybe as a student, as a young worker or as an exchange student.
We thought of creating an application that makes the task of searching a new flatmate enjoyable and easy.

Application:
The application is structured in the style of the dating app Tinder, except that a user doesn't search for people based on their appearance, but he searches for flatmates that match some criteria that he can set and eventually update.

Structure:
The application will have a login screen, where one can login in or sign up, if the user logs in he will navigate to the homepage, if he signs up he will navigate to a screen where he must inputs personal information and then he navigates to a questionnaire screen where he must insert some search constraints for the flatmates.

After filling the questionnaire out they will be sent to the homepage.

The main part of the application is divided between three screens, the homepage screen, the personal profile screen and the search screen.

The homepage screen has the newest postings, where one can see the most recent people that joined the application and how many likes they have received, as well as a list of users he has saved.

The personal profile screen shows the personal information and the personal constraints. It is also possible to go to the settings screen.
The settings screen shows some settings that the user can change, for example he can change his personal data, his searching constraints, or get information about the application and the user can also log out from the application.

In the search screen the user can search for the most fitting flatmate profile, if the user is interested he can send a like or can send an email to that person or also saved the user in the list of saved users, if the user is not interested he can press the not interested button and it will appear the second most fitting profile and so no.
Another functionality the user has is that he can see on a map where is the location of the person he is watching and see how far he is from his current location.
