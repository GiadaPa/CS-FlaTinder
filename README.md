# FlaTinder
Project 3 for Engineering of Mobile Systems

Context:
Almost everyone has struggled, at least once in their life, finding a shared house, maybe as a student, as a young worker or as an exchange student.
We thought of creating an application that makes the task of searching a shared house or a new flatmate enjoyable and easy.

Application:
The application is structured in the style of the dating app Tinder, except that a user doesn't search for people based on their appearance, but he searches for flats or flatmates that match some criteria that he can set and eventually update.

Structure:
The application will have a login screen, where one can login or sign in, if the user logs in he will navigate to the homepage, if he signs in he will navigate to the questionnaire screen.

The questionnaire screen, is a screen where the user will insert his personal information, it will have two buttons, one is used if the user searches for a flat, the other is used if he searches for flatmates. Based on what he is searching, he will be sent to a specific questionnaire.
After filling the questionnaire out they will be sent to the homepage

The main part of the application is divided between three screens, the homepage screen, the personal profile screen and the search screen.

The homepage screen is divided into the newest postings, where one can see the latest flats published or the latest people that joined the application based on the personal constraints, and the notifications received.

The personal profile screen shows the personal information with some styling. It is also possible to go to the settings screen.
The settings screen shows some settings that the user can change, for example he can change his personal data, his searching constraints, or get information about the application.

In the search screen the user can search based on his previously inserted constraints or with new updated constraints. If he searches for a flat he will get the most fitting flat profile, if the user is interested he swipes *left* and can see more information about the flat and he can then also send a request, if the user is not interested he can swipe *right* and will get the second most fitting flat and so no.
If the user searches for a flatmate he will get the most fitting person, if he is interested he can swipe *left* and get more information and also send him a request, otherwise he can swipe *right* and get the second most fitting person and so on.
